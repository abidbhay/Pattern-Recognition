Paper Title: Time Series Forecasting using LSTM Networks - Predicting Individual Household Electric Power Consumption

Abstract:
Time series forecasting is a common task in many real-world applications,
such as demand forecasting, stock market prediction, and
weather forecasting. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are well-suited
for modeling time series data due to their ability to retain information
from previous time steps in their hidden state. In this paper,
we review the use of LSTM networks for time series forecasting,
including the various methods and techniques that have been proposed
and their relative advantages and disadvantages. We also
discuss some of the challenges and considerations involved in using
LSTM networks for time series forecasting, and provide some best
practices for designing and training effective LSTM models
